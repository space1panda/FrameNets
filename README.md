# FrameNets

### The library contains my works on ml/dl with Python3:
#

  
  
##### ASSETS - contains data sets for various model trainings
  
##### DATASOURCES - contains datasource objects as well as dataloaders
  
##### EXPERIMENTS - contains all results on hyperparameters wrangling
  
##### INFERENCES - contains ready-to-use modules as well as trained parameters
  
##### MODELS - contains models objects
  
##### TRAINERS - contains trainers objects
  
##### UTILS - additional handy objects/methods useful for faster production

#

##### In addition you can also find some jupyter files, containing some more comments and code wrangling

#

### Current  list of solutions:

#### 1. Fairy Country Generator:
##### Char-based language model RNN (numpy-only)
#

   ###### Testing
    git clone mlprojects
    cd mlprojects/inferences
    python generate_country.py
    
   ###### Training
    git clone mlprojects
    cd mlprojects/experiments
    python fairy_land_generator.py
  ##### config files&terminal inteface will be added...

#### 2. Poems Generator:
##### token-based language model with LSTM (PyTorch)
   ###### in progress
